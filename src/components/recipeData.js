When it comes to kapama, the most important thing is to use a clay pot container. I used a 1.5 gal (5 L) one. Prepare the different types of meat by cutting them into coarse pieces. I like to put them in another container together. Then chop the onions and sauerkraut. At the bottom of the clay pot, put the onions and sauerkraut, then a layer of meat of every type, sprinkle with the spices, stir slightly, then arrange sauerkraut again, meat, spices, meat, sauerkraut. I like to put 3 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped, but you can add them whole. I like adding paprika as well.",

Once mixed, you should have a smooth, yellow-colored mixture, as shown below. Add the crumbled feta cheese to the egg-yogurt mixture. We prefer getting our feta whole and crumbling it with a fork rather than buying the cheese pre-crumbled. On each filo sheet, add some of the egg-cheese mixture. If using our measurements and a 9-inch pan, then use about 1/6 of the egg-cheese mixture on each filo dough sheet. Add tiny cubes of butter on each filo dough sheet. Again, if using our measurements, you’ll be using 1/6 of the butter on each filo sheet. Take the short edge of the filo dough, and roll each sheet. instructions, about 9 minutes.In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer.

Add the shredded cabbage and carrots to the pan, and cook the mixture over medium heat, for around 10 minutes. While your diced and shredded vegetables are cooking, you have time to prepare both the meat and rice, ready to add to the pan in due course.
